      <h2>1. Controller</h2>
      <p>
        Controller (data protection law):<br />
        <b>FahrFlex Project Team</b> (University Prototype)<br />
        Hochschule Neu-Ulm (HNU)<br />
        89231 Neu-Ulm, Germany<br />

      </p>

      <h2>2. Scope and purpose</h2>
      <p>
        FahrFlex is a university prototype to demonstrate ride search, ride offer details, and joining a ride.
        The application is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Processed data</h2>
      <p>Depending on usage, the following data may be processed within the prototype environment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ride search inputs:</b> departure city, destination city, optional date/time, filters (seats, luggage)</li>
        <li><b>Ride request details:</b> pickup/dropoff location, luggage count, pet/kid flags, payment method selection</li>
        <li><b>Seeded test data:</b> driver/passenger profiles, car and insurance details (synthetic data)</li>
        <li><b>Technical data:</b> server logs may include timestamps and technical request metadata</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Legal basis</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of this prototype, processing is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest) in conducting a
        university project and demonstrating application functionality. If personal data is provided by test users, the
        legal basis may also be Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR (consent).
      </p>

      <h2>5. Storage and retention</h2>
      <p>
        Data is stored in a MongoDB database for the duration of the prototype runtime and development/testing cycles.
        Seed data may be re-initialized (overwritten) during development. No long-term retention concept is implemented.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Recipients and data sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Data is not sold and not shared with third parties for commercial purposes. Within the project context, access
        may be granted to course participants and teaching staff for demonstration, evaluation, and troubleshooting.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Cookies and tracking</h2>
      <p>
        This prototype does not intentionally use tracking technologies or marketing cookies. If standard technical
        cookies are used by the runtime environment, they are limited to necessary functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Hosting and data location</h2>
      <p>
        During development, the application may run locally on developer machines and/or in containerized environments.
        Consequently, data may be stored on the device running the prototype and is not necessarily hosted on a
        dedicated production server.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Your rights (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>
        If personal data is processed, you may have the following rights under the GDPR, subject to legal requirements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to object (Art. 21 GDPR)</li>
        <li>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Art. 77 GDPR)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: As this is a non-production educational prototype, rights requests are handled on a best-effort basis and
        may require you to provide sufficient information to identify the affected data.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Security</h2>
      <p>
        Appropriate technical and organizational measures are applied within the scope of a student project. However,
        this prototype is not designed or audited to meet production-grade security requirements. Do not submit
        sensitive personal data.
      </p>
